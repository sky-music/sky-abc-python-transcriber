I restarted but it's okay y'all :+1: :+1:

# Instructions

```

1. Copy this file and save it as `transcribe.py` to your Desktop
2. Open a Terminal and type: 

```
cd Desktop
python3 transcribe.py
```

It would be just `python transcribe.py` on Windows I think.

3. Use QWERT, ASDFG, ZXCVB as the harp keyboard, and <kbd>(</kbd><kbd>)</kbd> for brackets. Type a line, and press Enter each time you want to start a new line.

4. When done, press Enter to finish the song. You'll find a file named `(your-song-name)-html.txt`

Add this to the start of the file:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Sky Song</title>

    <style>
    body {margin: 50px; font-size: 30px; font-family: monospace; line-height: 50px;}
    span {width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 20px;}
    .row-A {background-color: #8ed5ff;}
    .row-B {background-color: #f1a3ff;}
    .row-C {background-color: #ffa59b;}
    h1 {font-family: "Avenir";}
    </style>

  </head>
```

and add `</html>` to the end. Remove the `.txt` part from the file name. (I should really fix this)

5. Double click on the file to open in a browser. Voila :blush:
