# sky-python-transcriber

This is piece of Python code that allows you to write [Sky](https://thatgamecompany.com/sky) song notations into a webpage. I restarted but it's okay y'all :+1:

Click the green <kbd>Clone or Download</kbd> button in the top right, and then Download ZIP.

# Instructions to install


1. Move the `skytranscriber.py` file to your Desktop (I'm using Desktop as an example for the instructions.)
2. Open a Terminal and type:

```
cd Desktop
python3 skytranscriber.py
```

It would be just `python skytranscriber.py` on Windows.

3. 
![sky-python-transcriber-cli](https://github.com/t1-tracey/sky-python-transcriber/blob/master/images/sky-python-transcriber-cli.png)

Use QWERT, ASDFG, ZXCVB as the harp keyboard. Brackets and spaces are allowed for notation. Press Enter each time you want to start transcribing a new line.

4. Press Enter on a blank line to finish the song. There'll be a file named `(your-song-name).html` on your Desktop, or whatever folder location you've chosen. Double click on it to open. Voila :blush:
