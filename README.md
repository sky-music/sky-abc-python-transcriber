I restarted but it's okay y'all :+1: :+1:

This is piece of Python code that allows you to write [Sky](https://thatgamecompany.com/sky) song notations into a webpage.

# Instructions to install


1. Copy the `skytranscriber.py` file and save it to your Desktop
2. Open a Terminal and type:

```
cd Desktop
python3 skytranscriber.py
```

This changes the directory to your Desktop, and then runs the file.

It would be just `python skytranscriber.py` on Windows I think.

3. Use QWERT, ASDFG, ZXCVB as the harp keyboard, and <kbd>(</kbd><kbd>)</kbd> for brackets. Spaces are also allowed. Type a line, and press Enter each time you want to start a new line.

4. When done, press Enter to finish the song. You'll find a file named `(your-song-name).html`. Double click on the file to open in a browser. Voila :blush:
