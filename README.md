I restarted but it's okay y'all :+1: :+1:

This is piece of Python code that allows you to write [Sky](https://thatgamecompany.com/sky) song notations into a webpage.

Click the green <kbd>Clone or Download</kbd> button in the top right, and then Download ZIP.

# Instructions to install


1. Move the `skytranscriber.py` file to your Desktop (or whatever location you choose, but I'm using Desktop as an example for the instructions.)
2. Open a Terminal and type:

```
cd Desktop
python3 skytranscriber.py
```

I am using a Mac, it would be just `python skytranscriber.py` on Windows I think.

This changes the directory to your Desktop (or whatever location you've chosen e.g. `Documents/projects`), and then runs the file.

3. Use QWERT, ASDFG, ZXCVB as the harp keyboard, and <kbd>(</kbd><kbd>)</kbd> for brackets. Spaces are also allowed but not working yet. Type a line, and press Enter each time you want to start a new line.

4. When done, press Enter to finish the song. You'll find a file named `(your-song-name).html` on your Desktop, or whatever folder location you've chosen. Double click on the file to open in a browser. Voila :blush:
